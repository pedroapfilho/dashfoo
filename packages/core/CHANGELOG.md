# @dashfoo/core

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 301dcce: Add `dockZonePolygons(rect, opts?)`: enumerates the full hit-region partition behind `resolveDockTarget` as five polygons (inner center rect + four edge trapezoids with diagonal seams). Shares the band default with `resolveDockTarget`, so a painted map always agrees with the live hit-test. New `DockZone` type exported.
- 1439a72: Static layouts: editing can now be disabled.
  - `@dashfoo/react`: new `editable` prop (default `true`) on `DashfooLayout` and `Layout.Root` — `false` turns off every structural edit at once (tab/tabset drag, close, rename, splitter resize, external drops) while tab selection, maximize, the overflow menu, and the imperative ref API keep working. New granular flags `resizableSplits` and `draggableTabs` (both default `true`); a non-editable layout also rejects drops at the adapter level, so external-source drags under a shared `DashfooDragProvider` can't land in it. Toggleable at runtime without remounting.
  - `@dashfoo/core`: new optional global attributes `enableSplitResize` (backs splitter resizing) and `tabEnableDrag` (tree-wide default behind `tab.enableDrag`).
  - `@dashfoo/theme`: disabled splitters (`[data-separator="disabled"]`) keep their gutter size but lose the grab pill and resize cursor; a tab without a close control gets symmetric padding so the label no longer sits lopsided.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7dcc411: External drag sources: drag new tabs into a layout from outside it (a widget list, a palette). `@dashfoo/react` adds `DashfooDragProvider` — sharing one drag manager between a layout and outside sources — and `useExternalTabSource({ createTab, label, disabled })`, which registers any element as a drag source. `@dashfoo/core`'s `dragDockMachine` gains an `external` drag subject that commits the existing `addNode` action on drop, carrying the `TabNode` returned by `createTab` (validated against the tab schema at drag start).
- 7dcc411: Upgrade zod to v4. Schema behavior is unchanged for valid payloads; invalid-payload error messages follow zod 4's wording.

### Patch Changes

- 7dcc411: Bound the undo history to the most recent 100 steps. Every action snapshots the full model; an unbounded `past` grew memory for the life of a session.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7e76a84: Add model and React support for row/tabset min and max sizes, plus a default tabset minimum size.
- 7e76a84: remove the unused migration machinery: `migrate` and `CURRENT_VERSION` are no longer exported, and the model's `version` field is pinned to `1` by the schema (`z.literal(1)`), so payloads in any other format fail validation

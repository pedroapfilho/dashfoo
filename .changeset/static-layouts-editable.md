Static layouts: editing can now be disabled.

- `@dashfoo/react`: new `editable` prop (default `true`) on `DashfooLayout` and `Layout.Root` — `false` turns off every structural edit at once (tab/tabset drag, close, rename, splitter resize, external drops) while tab selection, maximize, the overflow menu, and the imperative ref API keep working. New granular flags `resizableSplits` and `draggableTabs` (both default `true`); a non-editable layout also rejects drops at the adapter level, so external-source drags under a shared `DashfooDragProvider` can't land in it. Toggleable at runtime without remounting.
- `@dashfoo/core`: new optional global attributes `enableSplitResize` (backs splitter resizing) and `tabEnableDrag` (tree-wide default behind `tab.enableDrag`).
- `@dashfoo/theme`: disabled splitters (`[data-separator="disabled"]`) keep their gutter size but lose the grab pill and resize cursor; a tab without a close control gets symmetric padding so the label no longer sits lopsided.
